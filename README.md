# MovieApp_React  ( _Star Wars Films_ )

### Overview
_MovieApp_React_ is my first React app that I connected to a database. Initially, I used a web REST API ( [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) ) for simplicity. Then, I used [Google Firebase API](https://firebase.google.com/) to perform CRUD functionality with a database. I built this for fun while teaching myself React.

### Technologies
* JavaScript, React
* [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) ( The Star Wars REST API )
* [Google Firebase API](https://firebase.google.com/)
* OOP fundamentals:
  * Inheritance
  * Re-usable components

### How to Run
This app is currently only ran locally. Just do the usual steps:
* git clone the repo
* npm start 

### Lessons Learned
 This project was built with the assistance of a tutorial through Udemy that taught the _React framework_ ( 48+ hours ).
